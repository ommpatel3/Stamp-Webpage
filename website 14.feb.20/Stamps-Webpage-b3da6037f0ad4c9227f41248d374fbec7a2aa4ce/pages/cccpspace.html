    <h3><u>Country:</u> Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</h3>
    <h3><u>Issued:</u> 1964</h3>
    <h3><u>Denomination:</u> 50 Soviet kopeks</h3>
    <h4>This stamp commemmorates the the first multimanned spacecraft, Voskhod 2,
      which carried out its mission in 1964. The stamp features the 3 crew members
      of the spacecraft: (left to right) Engineer Captain Col. Vladimir Komarov,
      Technical Sciences Cosmonaut Konstantin Feoktistov and Doctor Cosmonaut
      Boris Yegorov. The Voshkod program succeeded the Vostok program and used
      many of the leftover components after that program's cancellation. It was
      designed my Sergei Korolev, the same man who led the development of
      Sputnik, the first satellite. Interestingly enough, popular legend states
      that Kruschev put forward the idea of sending a multi-manned crew into
      space after hearing about the 2 and 3 manned Apollo and Gemini spacecraft.
      Due to this rush, many "corners" were cut in the program. For example,
      Voshkod cosmonauts didnâ€™t wear spacesuits, infact the spacecraft also had
      no launch abort system or ejection system, which were removed to make space
      for the large crew</h4>
