    <h3><u>Country:</u> United Arab Republic</h3>
    <h3><u>Issued:</u> 1964</h3>
    <h3><u>Denomination:</u> 35 Egyptian millieme</h3>
    <h4>This stamp features an image of Nefertari, the queen of king Ramses the
      Great of Egypt. The cartouche in the hieroglyphics beside her contains her
      name. The United Arab Republic was formed in 1958, initially a political union
      which existed between Syria and Egypt, which is quite unusual considering
      both countries are not connected by land or sea. This republic was led by
      the famous Gamal Abdul Nasser who is known through Egypt and the Arab world
      for overthrowing the monarchy in 1952, modernizing Egypt, and being a large
      advocate of pan-Arabism. The union lasted until 1961, when the Syrian government
      fell after a coup d’état, leaving behind a rump state. Egypt continued to
      officially use the name “UAR” for itself until 1971</h3>
