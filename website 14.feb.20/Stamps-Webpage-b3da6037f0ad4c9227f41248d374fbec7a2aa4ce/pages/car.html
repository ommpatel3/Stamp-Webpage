    <h4>The Packard Light Eight was intended to be a high-middle class luxury
      car. Sold only in 1932, the car was meant to compete with models built by
      companies such as Buick and Chrysler and compete for their consumer base.
      Due to the release of the car being right in the middle of the Great
      Depression, it was a massive failure. The model was considered a failure
      as it could not lure away buyers from its rivals. Infact, it hurt sales of
      Packard's volume line, called the Standard Eight.</h4>
