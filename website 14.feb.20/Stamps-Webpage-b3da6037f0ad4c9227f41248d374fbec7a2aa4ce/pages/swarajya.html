    <h3><u>Issued:</u> 1988</h3>
    <h3><u>Denomination:</u> 60 Indian paise</h3>
    <h4>Two connecting Stamps from India issued to commemorate 40 years of
      independence. They feature the independence movement leader Bal Gangadhar
      Tilak (1856-1920) and his famous saying, “swarajya (self rule) is my
      birthright and I shall have it”. Also included is this same quote written
      in his native Marathi. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the first leader of the
      Indian independence movement and before Gandhi, he was the most widely
      known political leader. Infact, during his career, he was referred to by
      the British as “the father of the Indian unrest”. As a result of his
      oratory skills, he is often referred to as “lokmanya”, roughly meaning
      “one who is followed by the people”.</h4>
