    <h3><u>Country:</u> Republic of Colombia</h3>
    <h3><u>Issued:</u> 1944-1945</h3>
    <h3><u>Denomination:</u> 5 Colombian centavos</h3>
    <h4>This stamp has an image of the coffee harvest in the background. What sets
      this stamp apart from many others like it is the overprint on this stamp,
      of Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill, which was done to commemorate an
      allied victory of WWII. Even today, the coffee industry produces about 2
      billion dollars yearly, accounting for about 8% of Colombia’s GDP. In the
      past, this number was even higher as certain other industries like petroleum
      was not as developed. In terms of the overprint, it was generally done in one
      of three colours, green, red or blue, this one being the last. Also,
      interestingly enough the bottom of the stamp reads “American Bank Note Co.”
      which is the company which printed this issue of stamps.</h4>
