    <h4>This stamp features an image of Orville and Wilbur Wright, the brothers
      whose first flight in December 1903 began the era of heavier-than-air
      aviation. This aircraft, called the Wright Flyer was flown on December 17,
      1903 near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina and flew for about 12 seconds,
      36 meters. As the brothers couldn't intially decide who would fly the
      plane, they flipped a coin and Wilbur ended up winning. The stamp's print
      is lithograohed onto the paper, which gives it the unique graphic style.</h4>
