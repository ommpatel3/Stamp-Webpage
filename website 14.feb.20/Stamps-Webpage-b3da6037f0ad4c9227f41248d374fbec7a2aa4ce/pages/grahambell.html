    <h4>The stamp features an image of Graham Bell, as well as a winged figure
      crowning his likeness. The telephone lines in the background suggest his
      invention. Dr. Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) emigrated to Canada in
      1870 with his family to Paris, Ontario and later at "Tutela Heights," a
      community near Brantford, Ontario. During a visit there in 1874 he
      invented the telephone. The first telephone was manufactured in 1875 in
      Boston, but Dr. Bell gave his first successful demonstration of
      transmitting speech (one way) over a telegraph wire between Brantford
      and Paris, Ontario. Interesting enough, Bell favoured the greeting
      “hoy hoy” for use over the phone instead of “hello”</h4>
